Place your tag manager snippet(s) here so it's included on every page.

Examples:
- Google Tag Manager: paste the <script> in <head> and the <noscript> after <body> starts.
- Adobe Launch / Web SDK (Alloy): paste the <script> snippet(s) here.

This file gets inlined in each page via serverless include (copy-pasted here at build time).
On GitHub Pages this is just static HTML included by each page.
